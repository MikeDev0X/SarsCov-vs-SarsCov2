# SarsCov2_vs_SarsCov_analysis

This is a final project i did for school. It states the main differences between SarsCov2 and SarsCov, using the complete genome of both viruses, and analysing mutations.

My teammates and i also made an investigation about the history of both viruses in our locations, the main symptoms of both, and the main differences; The investigation gave us clues about the behaviour of both viruses and we intended to demonstrate the contrast between the two of them.

We also discovered that there was a huge difference in the genomic structure of both of them, that's why we focused on compare just the same genes. The remaining genes in both cases, were taken as certain percentaje of change based on its nucleotid chain size.
